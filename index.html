                On this special day, I just wanted to take a moment to express my deepest
                gratitude for everything you've done for me. Your love, guidance, and support 
                have shaped me into the person I am today.
                
                Thank you for always being there for me, through the good times and the bad.
                Your strength and kindness inspire me every day, and I am truly blessed to have
                 you as my mom.
                
                Happy birthday, Mom! May this day be filled with love, laughter, and joy, just
                like you bring into my life every day.
                
                With all my love, </br>
                Ahmed</p>
